Iterate on a name before proceeding to the logo and colors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] We have selected a name.

## Decision

**Selected Name:** Mobile Transporter

After reviewing alternatives (Drift, Synapse, Handoff, Nexus, Portage, Pulse, Weave), the decision was made to keep the original name "Mobile Transporter" as it clearly describes the product's purpose and is already established.

**Tagline suggestions for future branding:**
- "Move files between your devices"
- "Your files, anywhere you need them"
- "Simple file sharing, zero hassle"
